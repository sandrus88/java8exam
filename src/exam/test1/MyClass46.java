 *  What changes, independent of each other, can you make to your method so that it will compile?
	1) Set the exception to null and don't rethrow it;
	2) Declare IOException in the throws clause of your method;
	3) Wrap the call to another method within a try-catch block that catches RuntimeException;
	4) Wrap the call to another method within a try-catch block that catches Exception;
